# ðŸ‘‹ GeoJupyter

GeoJupyter is an open and collaborative community-driven effort to reimagine geospatial interactive computing experiences for education, research, and industry.

We aim to combine the approachability and playfulness of desktop GIS tools, the flexibility and reproducibility of coding-driven GIS methods, and the collaborative and storytelling power of Jupyter to enable more researchers, educators, and learners to confidently engage with geospatial data.
